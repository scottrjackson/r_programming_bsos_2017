1. What are the four primary/basic data types in R?
   - Practice creating a vector of each data type
   - Using c(), concatenate pairs of these vectors together
   - What happens?  What data types are coerced to what?

```{r}

```

2. Make a copy of the `iris` data frame
  - Using `sample()` pull the data apart into two random batches
  - Put the pieces back together with `rbind()`
  - Put the pieces back together with `bind_rows()` from the `dplyr` package, creating an ID that keeps track of which piece is which
  
  
```{r}

```
